2. **Fireworks** - Mixed physics settings  
3. **Particles** - Only particle effects
4. **Effects** - Confusing mix of everything
5. **Colors** - Color settings
6. **Background** - Background image settings

#### **NEW Structure (5 tabs - User-Centric):**
1. **🎤 Audio & Sound** - All sound-related settings
2. **🎆 Fireworks** - Everything about firework behavior
3. **✨ Visual Effects** - All visual effects and particles
4. **🖼️ Images** - All image processing and backgrounds
